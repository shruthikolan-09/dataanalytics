# Sleep Cycle Productivity Exploratory Data Analysis
## Overview
This project uses a dataset on Kaggle called the "SleepCycleProductivityDataset", it consists of various parameters to gauge Sleep Cycle and Productivity across different people, I was interested in taking up this dataset to explore what impacts Sleep Quality or Productivity in people and to practice and apply concepts like data exploration and data visualization

## Features
- Uses Pandas and Numpy for data exploration and manipulation
- Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for Visualizations
## Results and Insights
- Females have a higher caffeine intake than other genders which is between 140-160 mg
- Females Exercise more than other genders with the highest duration being 45 mins
- Males have higher stress levels
- Females have comparatively the lowest Sleep Quality, this probably is because of the high caffeine intake
